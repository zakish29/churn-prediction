# Churn Analysis and Business Sustainability
Churn analysis is the process of analyzing customer behavior and predicting the likelihood of customers discontinuing their relationship with a business, commonly known as "churn". Churn analysis is an essential component of business sustainability, as it can help businesses understand why customers leave and take proactive measures to retain them.

By analyzing customer churn, businesses can gain insights into factors that influence churn, such as product quality, customer service, pricing, and competition. By addressing these factors, businesses can improve customer retention and, in turn, increase revenue and profitability.

In today's competitive business landscape, churn analysis is more critical than ever. With a wide range of products and services available to consumers, customers have more choices than ever before. Therefore, it is crucial to understand why customers leave and what can be done to retain them.
